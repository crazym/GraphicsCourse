- Process:
    I started with texture mapping and it didn't take too long to implement after I figured how to update the (a, b) coordinates of the objects; then I choosed to do area light which was more straight forward and tested it on the original scene built in a3; after 

- Code Description

* Antialiasing: 
    RayTracer.c - main() - loop at random samples and take the mean color
* Texture mapping: 
    utils.c - TexMap() & ~Intersect to update the (a,b) coordinates      
* Area light sources: 
    utils.c - AddAreaLight()  
* Implement a cool scene: 
    RayTracer.c - buildScene()    
* Multi-threading: 
    compile.sh - `-fopenmp`; utils - pragma on loop (i, j) in main()            
* Refraction:
    RayTracer.c - rtShade()
* Normal mapping:
    RayTracer.c - findFirstHit() update normal by (2*color - 1)
* Alpha mapping:
    utils.c - alphaMap(); RayTracer.c - rtShade() uses either obj->alpha or alpha at (a, b)   
* Depth-of-field:
    RayTracer.c - main() - loop at random cam & focal hit samples and take the mean color
